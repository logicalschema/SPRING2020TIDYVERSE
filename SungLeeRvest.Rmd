# Purpose
Not all web pages are created the same. Oftentimes, in trying to analyze data, we will need a handy utility to scrape web pages. The package `rvest` is a handy Tidyverse package that will save time having to "harvest"^[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/rvest.pdf p 1] web pages.




# Preparation
We will need to load the library for `rvest`.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(rvest)           # Tidyverse package for rvest
```

To take a look at what `rvest` can do, let's scrap the FiveThirtyEight web page at https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/^[The download was taken on March 12, 2020 at 10:28 PM EST]. Please note that I downloaded a copy of the html for the page and placed it in this [link.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logicalschema/SPRING2020TIDYVERSE/master/fivethirtyeight.html)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logicalschema/SPRING2020TIDYVERSE/master/firvethirtyeightscreenshot.png)

The following code allows you to read a URL into your program.

```{r}

# This line reads the contents of the url into sampleHTML. 
# The function read_html can also take a string of HTML code.
sampleHTML <- read_html("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logicalschema/SPRING2020TIDYVERSE/master/fivethirtyeight.html")

```




# Helpful Functions {.tabset}

`rvest` has some helpful functions to help you parse HTML code.


## html_nodes()

Because HTML (a subset of XML) is a markup language that wraps up text in tags (i.e. nodes), you can select specific HTML tags from a web page.

`html_nodes()` allows you to grab all of the HTML tags from the page. In this example, I grab the `<img>` tags for the web page.

```{r}
sampleHTML %>%
  html_nodes("img") 

```

## html_attr()

Sometimes the information you need is nested inside the HTML tag. You can use the `html_attr()` function to extract specific attributes for a HTML tag.

Let's look at all of the `<a>` tags for the sample FiveThirtyEight page. `<a>` tags contain hyperlinks for standard HTML. So as we grab the `<a>` tags, let's get the hyperlinks associated with them.

```{r}
sampleHTML %>%
  html_nodes("a") %>%
  html_attr("href")
```


## html_table()

The `html_table()` function comes in handy if you need to convert a HTML table to a data frame. 

Let's convert the HTML table found on the sample FiveThirtyEight page. Note: for this function it assumes^[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/rvest.pdf p 8]:  

  * No cells span multiple rows  
  
  * Headers are in the first row

```{r}

# dataIndexMobile can be found by looking at the "id" for the table
# Example: If you wanted <table id="dataIndexMobile">, you would use #dataIndexMobile
# Initially the table for the web page does not meet the 1st condition described above.


sampleHTML %>%
  html_node("#dataIndex") %>%
  html_table(fill = TRUE)   # fill = TRUE for badly formed HTML tables

```
